# Second-Hand-Car-Price-Predictions

There is a huge demand of used cars in the Indian Market today. As sale of new car have slowed down in the recent past, the pre-owned car market has continued to grow over the past year and is larger than the new car market now. Consider this: In 2018-19, while new car sales were recorded at 3.6 million units, around4 million second-hand cars were bought and sold. There is a slowdown in new car sales and that could mean that the demand is shifting towards the pre-owned market. In fact, some car sellers replace their old cars with pre-owned cars instead of buying new ones.

The goal here is to predict the Price of an Old car based on the variables provided in the data set.
